# Python Challenge Scripts

This repository contains a few of my soltuions to [The Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/).

## Getting Started

Clone this repo into your Python3 environment and run the "Face_Eye_Detector.py" file

### Prerequisites

You will need the following modules:

```
numpy
cv2
scipy.io
inception_v3 from keras.applications
random
```
## Usage

Once the program is running, it should automatically begin detecting both faces and eyes.
There is additional "fun" functionality to apply hats to the heads of the detected faces by pressing 'h'.

The program can be closed by pressing 'q'.
